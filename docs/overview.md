### Data Science Project

Yet Discovering...

## Types of documents to make

To create documentation for a Data Science Machine Learning Project, follow these steps:

1. Create a **wireframe document** to outline the basic structure and layout of the project.
2. Write a **detailed project requirements document (DPR)** that outlines all of the features and functionalities of the project.
3. Create a **technical architecture document** that details the high-level design of the project.
4. Write a **low-level design document (LLD)** that outlines the technical details of how the project will be implemented.
5. Create a **high-level design document (HLD)** that explains the overall system architecture and how the various components of the system will interact with one another.
6. Include **any relevant files**, such as videos or images, that will help clarify the project's design and functionality.

> ðŸ’¡ Remember to make sure that **all documentation is clear, detailed, and easy to understand**. Also, keep in mind that the **documentation should be a living document that is updated regularly** throughout the course of the project.
