### 1. Introduction

The Project Architecture Document provides an overview of the overall architecture and design considerations for the {[ProjectName]}. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the technologies used in the system.

### 2. System Architecture

The project follows a modular and layered architecture to ensure modifying-ability, scalability, and maintainability. The major components of the system architecture include:

1. **User Interface (UI):** The UI component handles user interactions and provides a user-friendly interface for inputting required information and getting predictions.
2. **Application Layer:** The Application Layer serves as the intermediary between the UI and the backend components. It processes user inputs, performs data validation, and orchestrates the flow of information.
3. **Back-End Services:** The Back-End Services encompass various functionalities required for the prediction process, such as data ingestion, data transformation, data validation, model training, and model prediction.
4. **Machine Learning Model:** The Machine Learning Model component is responsible for predicting the {[ResponsibleForPredicting]} based on the input data. It utilizes trained models, algorithms, and statistical techniques to make accurate predictions.
5. **Data Storage:** The Data Storage component stores the input data, predictions, and other relevant information. It can include databases, file systems storage solutions.

### 3. Communication Protocols

To enable smooth communication and data flow between the system components, the following protocols can be employed:

- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Used for communication between the UI, Application Layer, and Back-End Services.
- **RESTful APIs:** Allow for standardized and stateless communication between components.
- **Database Protocols:** Facilitate data storage and retrieval operations between the Back-End Services and the Data Storage component.

### 4. Technologies and Frameworks

This project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Jinja2 templates for building the user interface.
- **Back-End:** Python as the primary programming language for implementing the Application Layer and Back-End Services.
- **Web Framework:** Flask for building the application server and handling HTTP requests.
- **Machine Learning:** Python library **scikit-learn** for implementing the Machine Learning Model.
- **Data Storage:** NoSQL databases i.e MongoDB for storing data.
- **Data Processing:** Python libraries like **pandas, numpy, imblearn** for data manipulation.
- **Data Visualization:** Python libraries like **matplotlib, seaborn, pandas** to visualize the data using python.
